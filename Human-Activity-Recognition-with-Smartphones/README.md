### Project Overview

 Problem Statement:
The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.


### Learnings from the project

 following concept learn after completing this project:

- learned to explore data insights in depth
- learned to implement Support Vector Machines
- learned  to perform feature selection with the help of Support Vector Machines
- learned  to find the best suitable hyperparameters with the help of a grid search providing a better understanding of the usage of hyperparameter tuning.
